Data in a program is kept in variables which are capable of storing a certain kind of data formats called data types.

**Data Types can be categorised into 3 types : **

1. Built-in Data Types (Primitives)
2. Derived Data Types
3. User-defined Data Types

|   DATA TYPE   |      MEANING      |    SIZE     |
| :-----------: | :---------------: | :---------: |
|     bool      |      boolean      |  undefined  |
|     char      |     character     |   8-bits    |
|    wchar_t    |     wide char     |   16-bits   |
|   char16_t    |   unicode char    |   16-bits   |
|   char32_t    |   unicode char    |   32-bits   |
|     short     |   short integer   |   16-bits   |
|      int      |      integer      |   16-bits   |
|     long      |   long-integer    |   32-bits   |
|   long long   | very-long integer |   64-bits   |
| unsigned char | single-precision  |   32-bits   |
|     float     | double-precision  |   64-bits   |
|    double     | double-precision  | 10/16 bytes |



#### Note : Number of bits each data type takes also depends on compiler and can change based on a system being 32-bit or 64-bit.

At the most ground level even alphabets and characters are just numbers, and these numeric values to alphabets were assigned by American Standard Code for Information Interchange ASCII. Under this system A  = 65, B = 66.....Z = 90.   a = 97, b = 98... z = 122, Numeric 0 = 48 and 9 = 57.

In 8-bit system the minimum and maximum number that we can store is 8-1 = Numbers stored in 7 bits as first bit is for signed bit. So, 0000000 to 1111111 = 127 is the numbers we can store in 8 bit system which is equal to 2^7. So if we change the sign then we can have another 128 negative numbers as well. So we can store total 255 numbers in 8-bit ranging from -128 to 127.
