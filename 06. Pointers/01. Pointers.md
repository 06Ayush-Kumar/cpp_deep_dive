# Pointers 

Pointers are a type of variable in C++. These are also there in C. Pointer is a variable which is used to store the address of the data. Based on this variables can be categorized into 2 kinds :

1. Data Variables (Used to store data)
2. Address Variables (Used for storing address)

A variable **```int x = 10;```** is int type variable with value = 10, and is a data variable. Say this int takes 2 bytes (assume) 200/201.

## Declaration of Address/Pointer Variable :

Address variables have * sign which makes them different from data variables when declared.

```c++
int *ptr ; // Can store the address of the data.
```

As ptr is also a variable but it is an address variable and it will occupy some space as well say it occupies 300/301 memory address.

If we say **```ptr = &x;```** Then the  address variable ptr will store 200 address value and thus will point towards x. ptr has address of x and is pointing to x, showing the location of x. That's why it is called pointer.

```c++
int *ptr ; // Declaration of a pointer.
ptr = &x ; // Initialization of a pointer.
cout << x ; // Gives output as 10.
cout << &x ; // Gives 200, address of x.
cout << ptr ; // 200, address of x as we did ptr = &x above
cout << &ptr ; // Gives 300, address in memory for ptr.
cout << *ptr; // Displays the data stored at the memory address which ptr holds i.e. 10 Dereferencing
```

```c++
// Declaration of  a pointer using *
int *ptr;

// Initialization of a pointer : Feed in the address of variable to which you want ptr to point to
ptr = &x ;

// Dereferencing the pointer : Accessing the data stored at the memory location ptr holds as value
cout << *ptr ; // Will print the data of the memory address pointer is pointing to. In above example address 200 had the data 10.
```
